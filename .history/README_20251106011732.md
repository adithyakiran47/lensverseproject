Lensverse Project
Overview
Lensverse is a full-stack photography service platform designed to connect clients with professional photographers in categories such as event coverage, automotive photography, and portraits. The project provides a modern, easy-to-use interface for users to browse photography portfolios, book photography sessions, and for admins to manage bookings securely.

This project was undertaken to demonstrate expertise in:

Developing a full-stack web application using React on the frontend and Express with MongoDB on the backend.

Deploying modern applications on cloud platforms such as Vercel for frontend and Railway for backend.

Handling user authentication, secure data storage, and real-time booking management.

Dealing with deployment challenges including CORS, environment variables, and serving static assets from backend.

Project Structure
lensverse-client/: React frontend application.

lensverse-server/: Express backend API with MongoDB database integration.

Backend serves public assets (images) from public/assets folder.

Local Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/adithyakiran47/lensverseproject.git
Backend setup:

text
cd lensverse-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Fill .env with MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL set to your local frontend URL
node server.js
Frontend setup:

text
cd ../lensverse-client
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Set REACT_APP_API_BASE to your local backend URL
npm start
Deployment Instructions
Backend (Railway)
Create a Railway project, link GitHub repo.

Set root directory as lensverse-server.

Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:

MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string.

JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT tokens.

FRONTEND_URL: Frontend URL from Vercel (without trailing slash).

Deploy and ensure backend is running and serving /assets statically.

Frontend (Vercel)
Create Vercel project, import GitHub repo.

Set root directory as lensverse-client.

Set Environment Variable on Vercel:

REACT_APP_API_BASE to Railway backend API URL.

Build Command: npm run build, Output Directory: build.

Deploy and test the frontend.

Important Configuration Notes
CORS: Backend must allow frontend URL in CORS without trailing slash.

Static Assets: Images stored in backend must be referenced in frontend with full backend URL (e.g. https://backend-url/assets/image.jpg).

MongoDB Atlas: Whitelist Railway IPs or use 0.0.0.0/0 for Network Access to allow backend DB connections.

Case Sensitivity: File names for CSS and JS imports must exactly match in casing due to Linux-based deploy environments.

Troubleshooting Tips
If encountering build errors, check file import casing and environment variables.

For CORS and server errors, verify backend logs on Railway and ensure the correct origin is allowed.

If login fails, verify admin user exists in the production database with bcrypt-hashed password.

Static images not loading? Confirm full backend URL usage in frontend image sources.
