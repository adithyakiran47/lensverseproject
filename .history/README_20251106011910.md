# Lensverse - Photography Service Platform

## Overview

Lensverse is a full-stack photography service web application designed to showcase photographers' portfolios, offer booking services for photography sessions, and provide an administrative dashboard for managing bookings and user authentication. The project combines React as the frontend, Express.js backend, and MongoDB for data persistence, deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend).

### Problem Solved

Traditional photography booking involves fragmented communication and manual management. Lensverse streamlines this process by providing a seamless online platform for clients and administrators to manage photography services efficiently.

- JWT-based secure routes for admin actions.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- CORS configured for frontend integration

### Frontend
- React with functional components and React Router
- Axios for API requests
- Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling
- Environment variables for API base URLs

---

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ and npm
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- Accounts on Vercel and Railway for deployment

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/adithyakiran47/lensverseproject.git

text
2. Backend setup:
cd lensverse-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env

Edit .env with MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL
node server.js

text
3. Frontend setup:
cd ../lensverse-client
npm install
cp .env.example .env

Set REACT_APP_API_BASE to your backend URL
npm start

text
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

---

## Deployment

### Backend
- Deploy on Railway:
- Set environment variables `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`.
- Point root directory to `lensverse-server`.
- Serve static assets from `public/assets`.

### Frontend
- Deploy on Vercel:
- Set root directory to `lensverse-client`.
- Set environment variable `REACT_APP_API_BASE` to backend API URL.
- Build with `npm run build`.
- Output directory `build`.

---

## Important Configurations

- Ensure no trailing slashes in URLs for CORS origin.
- Whitelist Railway IPs in MongoDB Atlas Network Access.
- Static assets served from backend require full backend URL on frontend.
- Case-sensitive imports in React (CSS and JS files).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot login:** Confirm admin exists with hashed password in MongoDB.
- **Images not showing:** Use full backend URLs for assets served by backend.
- **CORS errors:** Verify backend CORS config matches frontend exactly.
- **Deployment fails:** Check build logs for case-sensitivity or environment issues.
